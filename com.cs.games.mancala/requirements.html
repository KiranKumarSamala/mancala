<h1>Mancala Game</h1>
<p>An ancient board game, believed to be more than several thousand years old!</p>
<p>The game has the following starting set up:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Two players</li>
  <li>A board containing 2 sets of 6 cups for each player laid out in two lines 
  of 6 facing each other, with one larger &quot;end cup&quot; on the left of the players 6 
  normal cups</li>
  <li>4 beads in each of the players normal cups</li>
</ul>
<p>The game has the following rules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Players take turns to move beads from any of their normal cups. </li>
  <li>In a move a player places the beads in every cup after the chosen cup, 
  clockwise round the board. </li>
  <li>In a move a player never places beads in their opponents end cup. (The 
  opponents end cup is skipped)</li>
  <li>If the move ends in the players end cup - they get another go.</li>
  <li>If the move ends in a players cup that was empty. They collect that last 
  bead and any beads in the opponents cup opposite the last cup.</li>
  <li>Play finishes when either player has no more moves to make (no more beads 
  in any normal cups)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Computer game requirements</h2>
<p>This computer game version shall support the following ideas/requirements:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A graphical user interface depicting the board, cups and beads.</li>
  <li>Human and/or computer players</li>
  <li>Complete undo/redo support for moves (back to start of game) - to allow 
  the user to experiment with alternative moves</li>
  <li>Computer &quot;hints&quot; - indicating the &quot;best&quot; move selected by game AI</li>
  <li>Computer &quot;hints&quot; - indicating the scoring mechanism used by the AI for 
  each move available - with the ability to drill down into the game &quot;tree&quot; to 
  look ahead 'N' moves (OPTIONAL: Plug-in)</li>
  <li>Pluggable front ends: The ability to choose command line, Swing, JSP, CLDC, 
  WAP or SWT GUIs... arbitrarily (Game logic must be separate) with possibly two 
  simultaneously?? (e.g. Swing and command line)</li>
  <li>Ability to challenge a remote player - via TCP/IP sockets - and keep two 
  versions of the game (with potentially different UIs) in synch</li>
</ol>
<h2>Design implications of requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use command pattern for moves - to support do, undo, redo</li>
  <li>Use MVC pattern - Model to support making moves according to underlying 
  rules and identifying &quot;game over&quot;</li>
  <li>Central model must be event driven - and supply feedback of move 
  acceptance or rejection.</li>
  <li>Model must be able to be queried for the current allowed moves and the 
  current player</li>
  <li>Remote versions of the game will act like another source of &quot;moves&quot; from 
  the opponent</li>
  <li>Moves will be given suitable sequence ID so that remote &quot;loss of moves&quot; 
  can be identified. </li>
  <li>Game remote communications will be asynchronous to avoid loss of 
  synchronisation between remote games</li>
</ul>
